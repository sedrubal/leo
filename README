               leo - a german<->english language translation script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

leo is a python script that queries dict.leo.org for one or more given keywords
and prints their meanings and translations to stdout

Installation
============

If you want to install leo system-wide, you should use setup.py:

 python setup.py install

This will invoke python's setuptools and install leo to the system's
site-packages directory and create an executable script in /usr/bin/leo
To choose other install locations refer to setuptool's help by invoking

 python setup.py install --help

If you do not wish to install leo system-wide you can simply call it by invoking

 leo/leo.py

from the directory you downloaded leo to.
Leo requires Qt4 to be installed, because it uses Qt's webkit renderer to act
as a headless browser to be able to properly parse the javascript created site
content.
Leo uses PySide as Qt4 wrapper. You can either install it by using your
distribution's package management system, or by installing it via pip or
easy_install.

Usage
=====

Start leo by invoking

 leo <keyword 1> [keyword 2] ...

when leo has been installed system-wide or by invoking

 leo/leo.py <keyword 1> [keyword 2] ...

from the directory leo has been downloaded to.
All translations found will be printed to stdout
